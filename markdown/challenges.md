**[Starter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1V5mJ-_2j83WkiyfXphvYQC-SBnHkPvJG?usp=sharing)**
**[Starter Zip (Contains more info)](https://td2020-static.s3.amazonaws.com/stock-prediction.zip)**

Can you predict the future of stock? We recommend using reinforcement learning but do whatever works best!


**How We Judge**

You'll submit your machine learning model to a link we will provide. You're project will solely be judged on your model's performance (how much money your model makes) on unseen stock time series data.

</center>

**[Starter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b1wgAd4wfA16L52kwO-yWtp25cyJiXOd?usp=sharing)**


There are a lot of factors that go into making a big move, and for many people, the top priority is either their job or their family. But if you‚Äôre on your own and you have job flexibility to go basically wherever you want (i.e. you work remotely), then what? In that case, you have the luxury of finding a place that suits you‚Äîand not necessarily just your career.

A myriad of decisions go into picking the perfect place to call home ‚Äî political leanings, crime rates, walkability, affordability, religious affiliations, weather and more ‚Äî can you make a tool that allows aggie graduates and others to find thier next move?


[High speed internet](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/best-cities-to-live-work-remotely) (of all people?!) made a tool to do this.... but you can do better! Think of more factors: like median income of a location, cuisine, primary ethnicity, pollution index, happiness index, number of coffee shops or microbreweries in the city, etc. There's no end! Furthermore, maybe you are an international student and want to make this tool for global placement! Go for it! Maybe you want to penalize distance from POI's (points of interest) like family. Do it! The world is your oyster!


**How We Judge**

- *Data Use*: Effectively used data, acquired additional data
- *Analytics*: Effective application of analytics (bonus points for ML/clustering techniques)
- *Visualization*: Solution is visually appealing and useful (Bonus points if you create an interactive tool/application/website)
- *Impact*: Clear impact of solution to solving problem

### Walmart
</center>


We want you to build a product search engine. Walmart is a fortune 1 retail company that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount departments stores and grocery stores, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. Apart from these Walmart has a big online business with well over 65+ online banners under its name including Walmart.com. Naming a few such as Moosejaw, Bonobos, jet etc.
 
The main area of focus is to provide a customer a consistent user experience when he/she is searching for a product from our website. We achieve that by developing consistent product clusters based on learning rule analysis on Walmart.com but also by overlaying some natural language processing with the use of indexes to get meaningful results when a query is provided.
 
Now let us talk about some of those tasks that need to be completed to successfully complete the hack.
 
- Task 1
 
	- Teams will be responsible for crawling the Walmart.com to assemble a collection of 20,000 products web pages and their Web graph. For this hack we are going to consider at least 9 categories with Food, Electronics, Personal care, Toys and Home as compulsory categories but the team has liberty to choose 4 other categories of their liking.
 
- Task 2
 
	 - Teams will be responsible for indexing the crawled web pages and for the link analysis of the Web graph that was retrieved by crawling. Participants shall choose any one of the relevant models of their liking such as the vector space model, probabilistic model, latent semantic or linguistic and knowledge base model. I highly recommend the last model.
 
- Task 3
 
	- Teams shall be responsible for clustering the product web pages that were crawled. Please be sure to provide at least two clustering criteria and use domain evaluation metrics to compare between them. Select one of the clustering criteria to improve the relevance model
 
- Task 4
 
	- Teams will be responsible in enabling queries to be entered and result to be present in a rudimentary graphical user interface embedded in the webpage that host your search engine
	- When a query is entered, the search engine should present the results of your relevance models against the query ‚Äì all of those that you have implemented;

Results of the search engine relevance against the query when clustering has been incorporated ‚Äì you should present the clusters that you have obtained as well.

We are looking for a project that helps put these beliefs into action. HPE is transforming how people interact with technology. HPE covers it all ‚Äì Edge to Cloud. AI/ML is a technology capable of transforming how we interact with others and our environment. Solving problems facing our communities is what we do. Whether that is enabling customers to assess the impact of wildfires, flooding, and other natural disasters‚Ä¶ or to create awareness of the impact of social injustices in our local or broader communities. Our customers' challenges inspire us to advance technology and create solutions - their success is our success.


**Challenge**

We are looking for projects that have clear benefits for our customers. Bonus points if you can show it could be deployed as a service. Be creative!

Teams should use datasets gathered from public sources.
